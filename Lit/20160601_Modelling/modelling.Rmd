# Error rate-bound method [@Metzler1974]

Aim: Determine CBPs for inhibition zone diameters.
Required: MIC cut-off, desired sensitivity and specificity.
Model: Classification according to this cut-off is treated as the ground truth. CBPs for inhibition zone diameters are set such that desired sensitivity and specificity are achieved for a minimal intermediate zone.

Ref.\ [@Brunden1992] presents a cost function and an algorithm for its optimisation to apply the error rate-bound method in cases with two different MIC cut-offs.
