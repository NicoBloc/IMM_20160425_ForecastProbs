# To do

* Allow the number of components to be variable.
* Compute confidence intervals: e.g. bootstrap for P(component | observed diameter)
* Issue warning if $|\mu-6\hspace{3pt}\text{mm}|>3\sigma$.
* Try different distribution, e.g., gamma. Check the packages mixtools and flexmix.

**For this goal, a model for the distribution of the wt is probably sufficient. The distribution of the non-wt could then be estimated as its complement. It could be obtained using Kronvall's method.**
